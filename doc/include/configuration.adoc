= Configuration in node-config

Hold your breath - we'll take a deep dive into node-config's Configuration.
Don't get lost in details - try to see the big picture.

The configuration is documented on a per-file basis - each OpenWRT configuration is explained individually.
Figure 1 shows the system from a birds eye perspective.

.Interface configuration - bird's eye perspective
image::interface-configuration.png[]

Node-config creates a hand full of interfaces: wlan0, wlan1, bat0, br-freifunk
as well as vpn interfaces like tap0 and ppp0. They are configured as follows:

.External interfaces (switch ports, radio)
* _wlan0_ and _wlan1_ are set up by node-config
** wlan0 is running in master mode. It's used by all clients.
** wlan1 is running in ad-hoc (or 802.11s) mode. This interface is used for meshing.
* _ethX (WAN)_ and _ethY (LAN)_ are created by OpenWRT. They are not configured by node-config.
** The LAN interface is used for a management (SSH / LuCI).
** The WAN interface connects to the internet. It can be used for internet sharing.
** Optionally, a VPN (openvpn, pptp, wiregard) can tunnel internet traffic.

.Internal interfaces (bridges, vpn)
* _bat0_ is the batman-adv interface of the system. It utilizes the ad-hoc interface for meshing.
* _br-freifunk_ is central: It bridges all clients (wlan0) into the roaming domain (wlan1).
* Other vpn interfaces (_fastd: tap0, l2tp: l2tpeth0_) are optional: They created and
 assigned to batman-adv and / or babel to mesh and roam using wires or directed wireless links.


Some interfaces are used by services to provide connectivity:

.Miscellous interfaces (not shown)include
* _DHCP_ and _radv_ services are running on br-freifunk. They hand out ip-addresses to clients.
However, these dropped on bat0 using ebtables to reduce broadcast / multicast traffic.
* _babel_ is running on the wlan1 interface and all vpn interfaces used for mesh routing.

WARNING: Mind not to bind the optional vpn interfaces to br-freifunk / bat0.
It is easy to have a catch-22.

Some interfaces are missing in the picture - have a look at the actual system:

.Additional interfaces
* Most interfaces have an IPv6 counterpart. These duplicates are needed by OpenWRT
* `internet_share` is a duplicate of the  WAN interfaces.
It's used for copying WAN routes into the freifunk routing tables.
* By default, node-config creates two optional interfaces using fastd. One is for
Routing within Freifunk communities (_enabled_), while the other is part of the
Freifunk / Gluon supernode template (_disabled_)


== /etc/config/wireless


The wireless configuration is generated using a shell script
Additional information in wireless
configuration can be found in the OpenWRT wiki. the https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/basic[OpenWRT wiki].

Please adjust if needed


.Content of `wireless.sh`
[#src-listing]
[source,bash]
----
include::openwrt/initial_configuration/wireless.sh[]
----


.Three things are done by `wireless.sh`:

1. It detects how many radios are available
* If there's a radio, 2.4 Ghz is assumed. It's locked to channel 1 and enabled
* If there's a second radio, 5 Ghz is assumed. It's locked to channel 36 and enabled.
* Other radios are ignored
2. If unused OpenWRT default configurations are present on a radio, they are disabled.
3. An ad-hoc interface with SSID `42:42:42:42:42:42` and an access point interface with SSID `Freifunk`
is created on all radios detected before. All ad-hoc interfaces use a broadcast rate of 12 MBit/s. While the 5 Ghz radio is using 40 Mhz,
the 2.4 GHz has 20 MHz.

=== Naming the Service Set ID (SSID):

You can adjust the BSSID and SSID according to your needs. Creating separated networks
requires using different SSIDs. For roaming, all SSID of a network must be the same:

On the one hand, moving to an accesspoint with a different SSID will reinitialize the wifi card -
all active connections will be lost. On the other hand, all mesh stations need the same SSID to connect to each other. The network
will fall apart, if they differ.

Keep in mind, that the _Extended Service Set ID_ (ESSID) is called _SSID_ in OpenWRT.
It is the network name shown on clients. The _Basic Service Set ID (BSSID)_ defines the technical identifier
of the ad-hoc segment. By its design, ad-hoc networks can fall apart by mistakenly generating different BSSIDs
for the same logical segment. Thus the BSSID needs set to fixed value. The issue is addressed by IEEE 802.11s.

For more details on service sets have a look at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)[wikipedia].

=== Using IEEE 802.11s

You can use the new IEEE 802.11s mesh mode instead of the new ad-hoc. To do so, you need to modify
`wireless.sh`.

.Modication to `wireless.sh` - example for radio0 (first radio, 2.4 Ghz usually).
[#src-listing]
[source,bash]
----
# ...
        set wireless.wifi_mesh='wifi-iface'
        set wireless.wifi_mesh.device='radio0'
        set wireless.wifi_mesh.network='mesh babel_mesh'
        set wireless.wifi_mesh.mode='mesh'
        set wireless.wifi_mesh.mesh_id='42:42:42:42:42:42'
        set wireless.wifi_mesh_fwding='0'
        set wireless.wifi_mesh.mcast_rate='12000'
# ...
----

When modifying the 5 Ghz network, use `wifi_mesh5` instead of `wifi_mesh`.

Setting `mesh_fwding='0'` disables forwarding in the IEEE 802.11s mesh network.
Forwarding _is disabled_, because  Babel and batman-adv need to see the topology on their own.
Forwarding would hide the structure of network from both babel and batman-adv.
In addition, it is redundant to batman-adv.

[TIP]
====
.If experimenting with IEEE 802.11s mesh forwarding:
1. Disable batman-adv - directly attach the mesh interfaces to the Freifunk bridge
2. Try to make babeld using the overlay metric
3. Avoid re-transmitting babel messages - IEEE 802.11s will distribute them anyway.
4. Happy hacking :-).

== /etc/config/batman-adv
https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki[Batman-adv] is used for roaming.
It uses all wifi ad-hoc interface (2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz). In addition, VPN (l2tp, fastd)
interfaces can be added to improving roaming when no radio contact is available.

The configuration does not contain any network interfaces. The mapping is done in
`/etc/config/network`. More details configuration options are listed in the
https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/Batman-adv-openwrt-config[Open-Mesh wiki].


.`batman-adv.uci` creates a mesh (`bat0`) using these options.
[#src-listing]
[source,bash]
----
include::openwrt/initial_configuration/batman-adv.uci[]
----

Having hardly any mobility in a Freifunk-style network, an originator interval of 5 seconds
is enough. Bridge loop avoidance, the distributed arp table
and ogm aggregation is enabled.


Fragmentation is enabled for roaming using wired interfaces. Usually, ethernet, l2tp or fastd
connections cannot transmit a complete batman-adv frame
using up to 1532 bytes without fragmentation.


== /etc/config/network

The network configuration is probably the most complex part of node-config.
Be brave, you'll make it :-).

Have a look at the https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/basic-networking
for additional help on OpenWRT's network configuration.

=== Network Interfaces
Let's look at the network interfaces first (cf. `network.ci`).

.These network interfaces are created in `/etc/config/network`

[#src-listing]
[source,uci]
----
include::openwrt/initial_configuration/network.uci[tags=interfaces]
----

That is it :-). Try matching these interfaces with bird's eye perspective picture in the
beginning (Figure 1).

NOTE: You might need to adjust some interfaces according to your local
setup (i.e. `internet_share` - use `proto 'static'` instead of `proto 'dhcp'`). All vpn and fastd interfaces can be removed, if vpn connections are not in use.


=== Routes & Rules

Node-config uses a dedicated routing table (66). This allows separating the mesh
from uplink and management networks. To build this table, all relevant IPv4 and IPv6 routes
are duplicated. In addition, IP rules assign mesh traffic to this table.

Have a look at the https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/[Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO]
for more information on policy based routing.

.Routes and Rules in `network.uci`

[#src-listing]
[source,uci]
----
include::openwrt/initial_configuration/network.uci[tags=routes]
----

Unfortunately, OpenWRT cannot create all rules using `/etc/config/network`. Thus
they're created using the firewall script `/etc/firewall.user`. Being part of node-config
`rules.sh` modies the the firewall script. `|| true` prevents `firewall.user` from failing, if
an interface is not available, yet.

[NOTE]
====
* When adding new interfaces to babel (i.e. l2tp connections), new
rules have to be added accordingly.
* The firewall is reload, when new interfaces become available.

=== PPtP configuration

`network_pptp.uci` has additional interfaces for PPtP. Due to this separation,
PPtP interfaces are not created, when using the node-config opkg-package, only.

.PPtP interface from `/etc/config/network_pptp.uci`

== /etc/config/babeld

https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/babel/[Babeld] is used for routing.
It uses the ad-hoc wifi interfaces. The optional interface tap-icvpn is included
for Freifunk routing.


.`/freifunk/initial_configuration/babeld.uci` defines these options:

[#src-listing]
[source,uci]
----
include::openwrt/initial_configuration/babeld.uci[]
----

== /etc/config/dhcp

OpenWRT uses dnsmasq and odhcpd to distribute prefixes. Node-config adds new
definitions to. The OpenWRT wiki explains the DHCP options in use:
[https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp_configuration[1],
 https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp[2]]

./etc/config/dhcp is used to
* Hand out IPv4 address configured manually (DHCP)
* Announce the IPv6 network configured manually (radv)

.Some configuration is done in /etc/config/network
* Re-distributing prefixes assigned automatically to the internet uplink (DHCPv6 PD).
* Annoucing the manually assigned /64 range for SLAAC.

.These stanzas are added by `dhcp.uci`

[NOTE]
====
* Using https://www.unbound.net/[unbound] for DNS is a good option when using
bigger router.

== /etc/config/fastd

Fastd is a simple, decentralized vpn software. By default, fastd does neither
switching nor routing. Both is handled by batman-adv and babel.

.VPN definitions `fastd.uci`
[#src-listing]
[source,uci]
----
include::openwrt/initial_configuration/fastd.uci[]
----

fastd is bound to the lan and lan interface, only. It makes no sense to use the mesh to
tunnel mesh packages. Unfortunately, interfaces cannot be referenced by its OpenWRT name -
thus the binding is done using shell.

.fastd binding: `fastd_binding.sh`
[#src-listing]
[source,uci]
----
include::openwrt/initial_configuration/fastd_binding.sh[]
----


== /etc/config/firewall & firewall.user

At quick glance, the firewall is used to seperate the mesh from other networks.
Firewalling is done using the OpenWRT firewall and ebtables. See
https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/firewall/firewall_configuration[OpenWRT -> Firewall]
for more information on OpenWRT's firewalling options.

.The firewall

* Creates a vpn and a freifunk zone. Forwarding from freifunk to vpn is allowed.
* Exposes the fastd vpn on the WAN interface (meshing, roaming via vpn)
* Makes the router accessible from the freifunk zone
* Takes care of NAT internet traffic
* Blocks broadcast / anycast traffic to the batman-adv mesh

CAUTION: Set a password on your router. It is accessible from the mesh network.

include::openwrt/initial_configuration/firewall.uci[]

Broadcast / anycast traffic is blocked using ebtables. ebtables rules are not
exposed via uci. `firewall.sh` takes care of adding this rules to the `firewall.user` script.

[NOTE]
====
For policy routing, additional ip-rules are added to `firwall.sh`. See <<_routes_rules>> for details.
====

== /etc/config/openvpn

OpenVPN is used to tunnel internet traffic.
Using external configuration files, the different providers are referenced, only.
[#src-listing]
[source,uci]
----
include::openwrt/initial_configuration/openvpn.uci[]
----

Here is an example for an external configuration. It can be used as a template
for other providers. Refer to
https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation.html [the OpenVPn website]
for information on different OpenVPN options.

----
include::openwrt/vpn/yanosz/client.conf[]
----

[NOTE]
====
.When setting up a new vpn provider, some settings need to be added to the provider's configuration:
1. `route no-pull` prevents OpenVPN from installing routes in the default routing table
2. `up /lib/freifunk/vpn/up.sh` makes OpenVPN installing a default route in the
freifunk table (66), when the interface is going up.
3. `script-security 2` allows OpenVPN to execute scripts such as `up.sh`
4. `dev vpn-nat` uses the correspondig interface defined in `/etc/config/network`
