= Advanced Topics

You made a long way. The documentation has many complex details and its quite easy to get lost.
Anyway, you made it :-).

This chapter focuses on advanced topics. It explains how to use node-config to build packages,
create a firmware and to do configuration management.

Illustrating underlaying concepts such as multihomming, roaming an Freifunk routing is also part of this
chapter.

== Building node-config

Node-config uses different Makefiles to generate packages and documentation.
When building node-config, architecture independent opkg packages ("all") are generated
using the OpenWRT SDSK.

Also, this chapter describes the underlaying network architecture and propose working methods for node-config.


=== Makefiles

Node-config is built using Makefiles. The project contains two Makefiles

* `./Makefile` is the global makefile. Packages and Documentation is generated using `make dist`.
Have a look at the makefile for other targets
* `./lede_build/node-config/Makefile` defines the actual opkg packages. By default, node-config is split in
`node-config` (base part), `node-config-openvpn` (openvpn configuration and dependencies) and
`node-config-pptp` (pptp configuration and dependencies).

== Generating a OpenWRT package repository (feed) ==

Running `make dist` creates a opkg package repository (feed) at `dist/feed`.

To use this repository on an OpenWRT router, all packages must be signed using a public/private keypair.
The private key is used to create a signature and has to be present on the router.
Keys are generating using `usign`, that is part of the https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/using_the_sdk[OpenWRT SDK].

.Generating a new keypair

[#src-listing]
[source,bash]
----
./sdk_home$ staging_dir/host/bin/usign -G -s secret.key -p public.key
./sdk_home$ cat public.key
untrusted comment: public key 9cf140f9fda134d8
RWSc8UD5/aE02AM7y99Y39xfadMna1qpT0sdFtVLU80I508fYqW+tXLG
./sdk_home$ mv public.key 9cf140f9fda134d8 # Change accordingly.
----
In this example, the key id is `9cf140f9fda134d8`. Thus the file `public.key` has to be renamed to
`9cf140f9fda134d8`. To use the key on OpenWRT, it has to be placed at `/etc/opkg/keys/9cf140f9fda134d8`.

.To create a signed feed, execute:
[#src-listing]
[source,bash]
----
$  make dist BUILD_KEY=/full/path/to/secret.key
$ cat dist/feed/Packages.sig
untrusted comment: signed by key 9cf140f9fda134d8

----

Copy `dist/feed` to a webserver and place a reference at `/etc/opkg/feeds.conf`.

NOTE: Consider make repository accessibly via http and https: opkg doesn't support SSL/TLS - the imagebuilder
does not require the key to present but supports TLS.

== A Graphical User Interface (GUI).

A Freifung-styled AngularJS based WebUI is available at https://github.com/yanosz/firmware-wizard-frontend. It's still under active development.
Contributors welcome :-).


== Creating Firmware & Configuration Management

Although node-config is not focussing on creating a firmware blob,
https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/imagebuilder[OpenWRT's imagebuilder].
can be used for doing so.

== Underlaying concepts

=== Roaming

Roaming concerns clients moving from one accesspoint to another. To keep all connections alive, traffic must
be redirected.

Roaming from A to B, the wifi association is updated: In the beginning, all data is transmitted to node A.
When changing the association, data goes via B instead. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Due to node A
and B using the same ESSID, the client interfaces is not reset.

.Roaming
image::babel-roam.png[width=70%]

In this scenario, packets need to be handled by a different nodes: While node A handle's the clients packets in
the beginning, node B is responsible in the end. This is, where things get messy: Network state needs to
be updated. IP-packets need to find a new way. However, some ideas exists:

1. _Creating a large, ethernet segment using batman-adv_: As done in classical ethernet networks, a
client's location is updated using _broadcast / multicast_ continuously behind the scenes.
In this a flat, MAC-based address scheme, routes cannot be aggregated. In Freifunk communities, these networks
are VPN based and scale up to 1000 ~ 2000 nodes.
2. _Update IP routing on roaming:_ Instead of creating a large ethernet segment, the network is split into
one segment per node. One dedicated subnet is assigned per segment. IP-Packets are routed between those segments
using traditional IP-routing. Whenever a client roams, a host route is added to the routing table. This
approach may reduce the size of the routing table. But in order to so, each node needs to know all IP-addresses
used by clients roaming into its segment. Getting only a mac address from the wifi association, this task is very
challenging. https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/l3roamd/network[l3roamd] tries to go this way, but it is not
ready for production, yet.
3. _Mobile-IP like approaches._ In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_IP[Mobile IP]
traffic is handled by a home node and passed along the network. It takes care of maintaining reachability
information and passing packets to its clients. As a downside, routing through a home node may increases the
forwarding path. In addition, management traffic for both batman-adv and babel has to be handled.

Combining babel and batman-adv, node-config includes configuration for a mobile IP like system, while not
being restricted to it. Its functionality is illustrated in the next sections:

At quick glance, using routing two routing protocols (babel and batman-adv) at the same-time
seems counter-intuitive: It's just duplicating the management effort, isn't it?
Of course, an ideal mesh protocol would take care of routing and roaming; propagating reachability
information on MAC and IP-addresses alongside. Unfortunately, no such protocol exist.



NOTE: In an Mobile IP like setup, the forwarding path doesn't increase necessarily.
In order to prevent source ip spoofing and to maintain NAT state in a multi homed network, external
traffic is routed via fixed "home-ish" gateway node in any situation.

==== Roaming in node-config using IPv4

Figure 2 illustrates roaming using IPv4.  A client roams from node A to B.
The traffic-flow is green, while network connections are red.

The batman-adv mesh cloud connects all segments _in transmission range_. It acts as a huge network switch.

.IPv4 Roaming
image::babel-ipv4-roam.png[width=70%]

The client is using 10.0.1.42 from A's dhcp range. By that, _node A is the home node_ of the client.
(Read this as: 10.0.1.1 is set a gateway using dhcp).

When roaming, node A is responsible for handling all the traffic. The client reaches node A (10.0.1.1)
 using the batman-adv cloud (and vice versa). Having batmn-adv's distributed ARP table enabled, ARP broadcasts
won't hurt the mesh. Thus - as in classical ethernet -
both are talking ARP using their MAC-addresses.

Keep in mind, that ethernet segments are _limited by the transmission range_ of the nodes.
There is no large ethernet segments connecting all nodes using a VPN.


==== Roaming in node-config using IPv6

For IPv6 the situation is more complex. In contrast to IPv4, clients have multiple addresses and gateways
provided by the radv-protocol.

In node-config, a distinct default route is announced by every router (distinct: unique link local address). When a clients roams to a
different node, it has two default routes, at least. This is illustrated in figure 4.

.IPv6 Roaming
image::babel-ipv6-roam.png[width=70%]

As before, the clients roams from node A to B. Before connecting to node B it is reachable at
fd00:1::42. This address is allocated using slaac in node A's segment. Node A is used for routing (route #1)

When moving to node B, the client receives an additional route (route #2) and address (not shown) from the
node B. Having two default routes, the client can access other networks via node A (route #1)
and node B (route #2).

* route #1:
** next-hop: link local address of _node A_.
** When selected, the client tries to reach node A by its MAC-address.
** mac-address: reachable via batman-adv
* route #2:
** next-hop: link local address of _node B_
** mac-address: based in the infrastructure network (no batman-adv).


Mind, that the traffic (inbound vs. outbound) is slightly asymmetric.

.From the client's point of view:
* Incoming traffic arrives via node A, only. To reach the client, it is send trough the batman-adv cloud.
* Outgoing traffic is somewhat asymmetric:
** If the client chooses the old route, traffic is reaching node A through the batman-adv cloud
** If the client chooses the new route, traffic _may_ by routed via node A using babel; external traffic
(i.e. internet) always leaves the mesh via node A due to source specific routing.


NOTE: Although babel and batman-adv are operating in the same topology, they use different metrics.
Thus babel and batman-adv may choose different paths from B to A.

Have in mind, that node-config blocks all multicast traffic in batman-adv including
IPv6 _Neighbor Solicitation_ (NS). By doing so, Node A has no chance to discover the client's mac address after roaming. Node config assumes:

.ICMPv6 NS assumptions:
1. All MAC addresses are cached while relevant.
2. Address collisions won't occur, since nodes have just a few clients.
3. A client learning a routers mac from a radv-message doesn't need NS to find the correspondig
router at all time.


==== Roaming in wifi range vs. planned roaming

If nodes are in in transmission range, roaming will be easy:
packets from B to A are sent using wifi, after the client moved from A to B.
This seems to be realistic: When a client roams, it is connected to the wifi all time long:
If the signal is lost, the network interface will loose its association and the connection is reset.

Unfortunately, this doesn't work out in any case:

.Problematic situations:
1. There're obstacles around (i.e. walls) shadowing one node: one node won't be able to reach the other - packets will get lost.
2. Retransmitting packets uses twice the airtime (at least). This reduces the overall performance.


[NOTE]
====
* Shadowing by obstacles causes _hidden_ and _exposed_ terminals
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposed_node_problem[wikipedia]). Try to avoid this, by putting some effort
into placing the nodes (i.e. line of sight).

* By default, all radios in the mesh are using the same radio frequencies to connect to each other.
This is good for sparse networks. For dense networks it is better to have devices with multiple radios,
operating on different frequencies. This involvces _frequency planning_
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_Planning[wikipedia]).
====

In these situations you can offload roaming traffic i.e. by using wired or directed links.
In many situations, its good to use a fastd based vpn (TODO yanosz: add a fastd example
configuration for offloading in node-config). While fastd is easy to setup and fits for many situations, other technolgies (ethernet, l2tp) provide
a better performance:

.To offload traffic on a layer2 broadcast medium:
1. Choose a medium for off-loading (i.e. ethernet, p2p-wifi, l2tp).
2. Create a corresponding
https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/basic-networking[OpenWRT configuration]
3. All all interfaces to babel in `/etc/config/babel`
4. Add all interfaces to the freifunk firewall-zone in `/etc/config/firewall`
5. Add policy-routing for these interfaces using table `66` in `/etc/firewall.user`
6. Add a batman-adv mesh definition for all interfaces in `/etc/config/network`.
7. Modify `/lib/freifunk/set_ip.sh` to set and IPv4-address (/32) on all related interfaces, execute it, reboot
the node.

Unfortunately, policy routing and firewalling makes it very complex to add a new link for offloading.
This is the downside of having a Freifunk-style exit-vpn using an arbitrary provider. When removing
this functionality, you can skip steps 4 and 5. Using fastd for all links somewhat simplifies this situation,
because - unlike l2tp - only one tap interface definition is needed for any number offloading peers.


[NOTE]
====
.Have in mind:
1. Having a shared network (i.e. ethernet switch, tinc in switched mode) creates a _full mesh_. Management traffic increases
quadratic in the number of nodes. Consider star or snowflake topologies using p2p links like fastd or l2tp.
2. babel and batman-adv use broadcast / multicast traffic for management. This is an issue when using
 directed wifi point-to-point links: By specification, this kind of traffic is sent using a _very low datarate_
to reach all stations in transmission range, drastically reducing the capacity of the wireless link.
Consider encapsulating this traffic using p2p-vpns like l2tp or fastd.
====


=== “Multihoming” & Prefix Delegation

A network run by node-config may have multiple internet uplinks.  Typically, internet uplinks are
provided by different providers using different IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

This is illustrated in figure 5.
By design, each node acts as a router:

* It routes packets using babel
* It runs in batman-adv gateway mode, handing out IP addresses.

.Multihoming
image::multihome.png[width=70%]

Routing packets internally is easy: Having distinct non-overlapping IPv4 and IPv6 networks per node,
every network is homed at an unique node. Each node announces its prefixes using babel - packets can be routed.
If a node is connected to the internet (uplink), it will announce a default route in addition.

NOTE: Originally, the term multihoming refers to a situation in BGP: A private autonomous system (AS)
announces its prefix via different upstream providers. Having the private AS-number removed from the path,
all networks appear to be originating from all providers; hence they are home to multiple places.

==== IPv4 & Network Address Translation (NAT)
By default, node-config uses private IPv4 space. To access the internet,
network addresses need to be translated
(NAT).

.IPv4 multihoming
image::multihome-ipv4.png[width=70%]

In figure 6 node A and node B are directly connected to the internet.
Node A is using 192.0.2.1 - Node B is using 203.0.113.1. In node-config, both A and B take care of NAT:
When leaving the mesh network, the sender address is changed to 192.0.2.1 (203.0.113.1 resp.).

This design assumes, that the route selection in babel is stable: From the perspective of node D,
both A and B have usable default routes; the choice is arbitrary. But
if D's selection changes (i.e. from A to B), the NAT will break: By turning over, the sender address
switches from 192.0.2.1 to 203.0.113.1. This breaks all the TCP session of all clients at D.

Babeld's stability is defined by the _half-time_ parameter -
see http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/babeld.8.html[man babeld] for details.

==== IPv6, source specific routing & Prefix Delegation

The situation is different for IPv6. Instead of translating IP-addresses, routers with internet connectivity
provide public address space to all other routers.

[CAUTION]
====
IPv6 is probably not mature, yet. Altough, node-config only use OpenWRT's core components and
follows IPv6's best practices by using prefix delegation, some details are likely to be broken.

In addition, node-config's IPv6 configuration is largely untested: Only a few vpn providers have
support IPv6 prefix delegation.
====


Address space is assigned using DHCP v6 prefix delegation. See
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633[rfc3633] for details. In figure 7, `2001:DB8:AAAA::/56` is assigned to
node A by its provider. Node B got `2001:DB8:BBBB::/56`.

To use these networks, corresponding addresses must be assigned to clients at nodes C,D,E and F.
In order to do so, at least one `/64` network must be assigned to each node.
Node-config is using the ad-hoc (or 802.11s) network for prefix delegation. Here's an example:

.IPv6 multihoming
image::multihome-ipv6.png[width=70%]

.Example configuration using DHCPv6 PD (dynamic).
* Node C is connected to A. It gets `2001:DB8:AAAA:1::/64`
* Node D is connected to A and B. It gets `2001:DB8:AAAA:2::/64` and `2001:DB8:BBBB:1::/64`
* Node E is connectd to B. It gets `2001:DB8:BBBB:2::/64`

Mind, that this configuration is dynamic: C,D and E may choose to request more than one prefix. In addition,
they can request a larger subnet (i.e. `/60`) for redistribution.

However, there's catch: If a client uses `2001:DB8:AAAA:2::42`, it must use node A
to access the internet - node B's provider will probably reject the packet due to address spoofing
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing[wikipedia]). Here _source-specific routing_ comes
into action. Node A and B announce a default route for their range, _only_. Babel takes care of using the
correct route

[NOTE]
====
Most internet protocols (i.e. BGP)  follow the _destination based forwarding_ paradigm: The route of a packet
is determined by its _destination address_, only.

_Source routing_ is an alternative to destination based forwarding. Here,
the _path is defined at the sender_.
This approach is done by some mesh protocols, implemented in IPv4, but hardly used.

_Source specific routing_ somewhat follows the destination based forwarding paradigm.
The route is determined by the sender address, only. In addition,
routes are restricted to a specified source range, limiting the set for destination based lookups.

Babel is using source specific routing, to comply with the destination based forwarding paradigm,
while taking care of multiple IPv6 networks in the same mesh.
It's sad, that most slaac-implemtations do not restrict routes like source specific
routing does.
====

Unfortunately, node-config's IPv6 functionality is hardly tested.

.Here'll be dragons
1. What happens, if node A crashes?
* Will D detect this?
* Will D stop announcing `2001:DB8:AAAA:1::/64`?
* Will D's client use `2001:DB8:BBBB:2::/64`, only?
2. Is DHCPv6 proxying better than redistribution?
* What's a good redistribution strategy? (density?)


===== A way out: Static IPv6 assignments.

As an alternative to prefix delegation you can assign IPv6 networks, statically.
By providing a public IPv6-network instead of an ULA-network (i.e. when using `set_ip.sh`).

This can be done using provider independent (PI) address space or space assigned by large tunnel providers
(i.e. https://tunnelbroker.net).

While this is fine for networks under a central administration, the Freifunk philosophy rejects the idea
of a central administration or uplink. See <<#_design_considerations>> for details.

===== A different way out? Network Prefix Translation

Network prefix translation can be used as an alternative to prefix delegation. Instead of
handing out public address space, ULA addresses are translated to access the internet.
(i.e. from `fdc3:337e:00c0:3f04::42` to  `2001:DB8:AAAA:5271::42`).
This is done on all border routers with IPv6 connectivity (i.e. nodes A and B).

Using ULA addresses removes the necessity of maintaining state for network delegations
(mind the dragons of Prefix Delegation). Unfortunately, this approach has some drawbacks

.Issues with network prefix translation:
1. End-to-end addressing is a _fundamental building block_ for IPv6 networks. Address translation
 is violating this paradigm. Expect issues with protocols expecting compliance.
2. As in IPv4 (c.f. figure 5) changing the path also changes the sender address and resets all TCP connections.
Unlike IPv4, you cannot set a fixed default gateway using DHCPv6
(DHCPv6 Route Options never made it an internet standard), thus we have to consider roaming, again:
 a. You can live with it
 b. You can translate all addresses to a statically assigned IPv6 prefix -
 but then you can do static IPv6 assignments anyway. There's no need to translate addresses, anymore.
 c. You can use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation for ULA addresses and babel's source specific routing. While this looks attractive in the first place
  (unexpected changes in external delegations won't ruin your day),
  the dragons of Prefix Delegation will still be there +
  (... what happens, if node A crashes ...)

== Freifunk Networking

Let's have a look at Freifunk: https://freifunk.net[https://freifunk.net] has a good
introduction into the Freifunk community, its motivation, goals and structure.

In contrast to a green-field mesh vpn, integration into existing community networks
is an issue - especially, if you want to use your router in an existing Freifunk network.
As of today, most Freifunk networks are based on
https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon[Gluon] or connect via the
https://wiki.freifunk.net/IC-VPN[Intercity-VPN (ICVPN)].

=== Gluon integration / migration

Node-config was developed with Gluon networks in mind. Also, it tries to overcome
some limitations of gluon networks. See <<#_Design considerations>> for details.

In gluon networks, node-config can be used as a node, supernode,
or vpn-offloader. Although all options are explained at this section,
doing so somewhat looses the focus of the points node-config tries to address.

Probably the best way to integrate a node-config router into a Gluon network is to operate it side-by-side.

=== Side-by-side operation ===

In side-by-side operation a node-config router is using the same SSIDs meshing on layer-2.
To so do edit `/etc/config/wireless` according to your Freifunk community.

It also interesting, to connect all node-config routers and supernodes using a routed vpn speaking babel.
`/etc/config/fastd` provides a icvpn template for doing so. This allows end-to-end adressing.

[NOTE]
====
Consider planned romaing (i.e. fastd from node-config to supernode),
if and only if a node-config router is in the vicinity of gluon node. The load will be challanging.
See <<#_Design_considerations>> for details.
====

=== Gluon Supernode ===


Node-config's internals are very similar to a gluon supernode: It speeks batman-adv over fastd and
provides DHCP as well as routing and ravd services. In fact, some supernodes are connected
using a backbone vpn using babel.  There're some smaller differences, still.

[NOTE]
====
Most OpenWRT routers probably lack the horsepower needed for a supernode
- even for a mediocre sized network.
====


.Differences between node-config and gluon supernodes
* Gluon supernodes to not speak babel to other (non-super)-nodes in the mesh.
* Usually, a DHCP pool of 250 addresses is not enough for a freifunk network.

Node-config contains a fastd supernode template. Enabling it goes like this:

.Starting a local supernode
[#src-listing]
[source,bash]
----
uci set fastd.supernode.enabled=1
uci commit
/etc/init.d/fastd restart
/etc/init.d/fastd show_key supernode
----
By that, a fastd instance is started on `10001/udp`. It's accessible using the WAN and LAN interfaces.
fastd's public key is printing using the `show_key` command.
It can to be integrated into the Gluon site configuration - for more information on configuring fastd
see https://fastd.readthedocs.io/en/v17/manual/config.html

To increase the DHCP pool, you need to change one line in /etc/config/network and /etc/config/dhcp.

./etc/config/network - increase subnet mask:
[#src-listing]
[source,uci]
----
config interface 'freifunk'
    # .. some other options ..
    option netmask '255.255.0.0'
----

./etc/config/network - increase pool:
[#src-listing]
[source,uci]
----

config dhcp 'freifunk'
    #   .. some other options ..
    option limit '10000'
----

=== Gluon node / VPN-Offloader ===

A gluon node is very lean: It connects to a supernode using fastd and speaks batman-adv.
It's not running any other service (i.e. babel, dhcp, routing).


Technically, there's hardly any difference between a gluon node and a vpn-offloader. Boiling
it down, a _vpn-offloader is a node_ also accepting incoming fastd connections.

Typically, vpn-offloaders are more powerful gluon nodes, deployed at large sites. Here,
only the vpn-offloader maintains a connection to the supernode.
All other nodes connect to the offloader instead. Having only one connection to the supernode
(instead of one connection per node), brodcast / multicast traffic is sent only once.
By that, traffic is reduced.


.To run a node of vpn-offloader
1. Enable the supernode fastd instance `uci set fastd.supernode.enabled=1`
2. Disable the batman-adv gateway mode `uci set batman-adv.bat0.gw_mode='client'`
3. Disable babel: `/etc/init.d/babeld disable`
4. Disable DHCP: `uci set dhcp.freifunk.ignore=1`
5. Commit & restart: `uci commit`
6. Change SSID and channel in `/etc/config/wireless` according to your Freifunk community.

Reboot the router, when you're done.

When running a node instead of an offloader, mind firewalling
the fastd-instance by commenting out the correspondig rule in `/etc/config/firewall`.


=== ICVPN routing

The Intercity-VPN network (ICVPN) is a tinc and BGP based network for connecting all Freifunk communities.
See https://wiki.freifunk.net/IC-VPN (german) for details.

Unfortunately, the design of ICVPN makes it almost impossible to connect using a small SoHo-router, only.
The configuration (BGP, DNS) is generated using python scripts operating on a cloned git repository.
Way to much for a small node. Thus ICVPN connectivity using DNS and BGP is outside the scope of node-config.

Looking at the big picture, BGP and DNS can be handeled on a different platform (i.e. RaPi running Debian),
exposing its connectivity using babel. Then, node-config can:

* Use routes learned via babel to connecting to ICPN hosts.
* Use a IPv6 anycast address for DNS.

Unfortunately, the Freifunk community rejected the idea of a DNS-TLD-naming convention,
thus delegations for all Freifunk DNS TLDs must be configured individually. Generating a suitable dnsmasq-configuration
is also part of the pyhton scripts provided by ICVPN. This manual won't go into detail here. See
https://github.com/freifunk/icvpn or https://wiki.freifunk.net/DNS for more information.

[NOTE]
====
IPv4 is futile. Use IPv6, only.
====


Still, node-config has a fastd-instance for ICVPN routing. It's integrated into babel but not into
batman-adv. In addition, there's a test peer providing basic ICVPN connectivity.


.Enabling ICVPN connectivity
[#src-listing]

----
uci set fastd.backbone.enabled=1

== Design considerations

Up to now, we were looking technical aspects. That's ok. You're reading a
technical documentation and - no regrets - it's supposed to be like that.
On the other hand, most design decisions are based on specific goals or requirements.
Here, at the end, it's time to connect the dots. These requirements are key to node-configs design:

1. _You don't need any servers_: Some Freifunk network designs promote data center based servers (supernodes)
to provide basic network functionality (i.e. routing, dhcp). This needs extra funding, requires a
reliable internet connection as well as a data center and introduces additional complexity. As a requirement for node-config,
 basic functionality has to be provided by the nodes.

2. _Use vanilla OpenWRT releases_: Many community networks are based on custom OpenWRT builds or forks.
To start a network, OpenWRT has to be compiled or forked at first. Usually, only a few people know how to maintain or
compile the software needed to run the network. Node-config is required to use OpenWRT as-it-is; using released
images and packages, only.

3. _Share your local internet connection_: Freifunk and other networks are built with the idea of having
one or many internet gateways providing connectivity. Unfortunately, many networks depend on an external
infrastructure (i.e. a fixed vpn provider).  For node-config, the need for a designated
vpn provider has to be eliminated. Node-config must allow direct
internet sharing  or using an arbitrary vpn provider.

4. _Wifi & OpenWRT configuration is all you need to know_: Introducing
servers or operating vpn providers requires additional knowledge in a community. For instance, supernodes
require management using ansible or puppet,  connecting to autonomous systems (AS)
(i.e. Freifunk Rheinland e.V.) via vpn puts the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) on the table. In its core,
 that knowledge is outside of running wifi mesh networks and raises the entrance barrier. Using node-config must not require any additional knowledge
(except OpenWRT configuration and wifi).

5. _Overcoming scaling limitations seen in Gluon based networks._ Many proposed
Gluon design scale up to 1000 ~ 2000 nodes per mesh. Basically, this is due to broadcast / anycast
traffic and batman-adv management sent to all nodes. Roaming-management traffic
is distributed across regions without any reasonable wifi coverage. Node-config is required to scale better
by integrating hierarchical routing and to limit roaming management traffic to definable regions.

6. _Be decentralized - no administration authority_. Node-config is desinged to implement decentralisation
(c.f. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic[Hacker Ethic (wikipedia)]). It is required, that no
administration authority is supposed to govern the network. Node-config is required to:
** Eliminate the need for network administrators (i.e. for servers or BGP routers)
** Empower people, by a simple and accessible design as well as documentation.
** Lower the entrance barrier (funding,  infrastructure,  know-how) for new communities.
